1.HTTP Basic authentication
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication
	
	In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method
for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request.

	HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for
 enforcing access controls to web resources because it doesn't require cookies, 
 session identifier and login pages. Rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses 
 static, standard HTTP headers which means that no handshakes have to be done 
 in anticipation.
服务端：
	Server side 
	When the server wants the user agent to authenticate itself towards the server, 
it must respond appropriately to unauthenticated requests.Unauthenticated requests 
should return an HTTP 401 Not Authorized response code containing a WWW-Authenticate HTTP header.
The WWW-Authenticate header for basic authentication (used most often) is constructed as following:
	WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="nmrs_m7VKmomQ2YM3:"
客户端：
	Client side[edit]
When the user agent wants to send the server authentication credentials it may use the Authorization header.
The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
	1.Username and password are combined into a string "username:password"
	2.The resulting string is then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to 76 char/line
	3.The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the encoded string.
For example, if the user agent uses 'Aladdin' as the username and 'open sesame' as the password then the header is formed as follows:
	Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
